# JavaScript Workshop Questions Day 1 JS Concepts

## Easy:

### Map, Filter, Reduce:
1. Double each element in the array `[1, 2, 3, 4]` using the `map` method.
2. Create a new array with only even numbers from `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` using the `filter` method.
3. Find the sum of elements in the array `[1, 2, 3, 4]` using the `reduce` method.

### Arrays, Objects, Rest, Spread:
4. Concatenate the arrays `[1, 2, 3]` and `[4, 5, 6]` to create a new array.
5. Create an object with 'name' and 'age' properties. Use object destructuring to extract and log the 'name'.

## Intermediate:

### Map, Filter, Reduce:
6. Given an array of strings, use `map` and `filter` to create a new array containing the lengths of strings that have more than 3 characters.
7. Given an array of numbers, use `reduce` and `map` to find the squares of each number and then calculate their sum.
8. Given an array of objects with a 'price' property, use `filter` to get items cheaper than $50 and then use `reduce` to find their total cost.

### Arrays, Objects, Rest, Spread:
9. Given an array of objects with 'name' and 'age', use `map` to create a new array of strings in the format 'Name is Age years old'.
10. Write a function that takes an object with properties 'a', 'b', and 'c', and returns a new object with the same properties plus an additional 'd' property set to 0. Use the rest and spread operators.

## Advanced:

### Map, Filter, Reduce:
11. Given an array of objects representing books with 'pages' property, use `map` to get an array of page counts, `filter` to exclude books with less than 200 pages, and `reduce` to find the average page count.
12. Given an array of objects representing students with 'grades' property, use `map` to create a new array of objects with an additional 'passed' property (true if the average grade is >= 60, otherwise false). Use rest and spread to achieve this.

### Arrays, Objects, Rest, Spread:
13. Write a function that takes any number of arguments using the rest operator and returns their sum.
14. Write a function that takes an object with properties 'a', 'b', 'c', and returns a new object with the same properties plus an additional 'd' property set to 0. Use the rest and spread operators.
